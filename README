     --matchup FILE         Rotate, grabbing header from FILE
     --validate             Discards rows that have wrong column count
     -n --head COUNT        Only process COUNT lines
     --default VALUE        Replace empty values with VALUE
     --grep COLS PATTERN    Search for pattern in cols

     --help                 Display man page

DESCRIPTION
    tsv is a collection of small tools for manipulating and reporting on TSV
    (tab separated values) files.

    --show
        Displays a numbered list of the columns

    --cut COLUMN_NAME(S)
        Outputs a new TSV with just the named columns. Columns must be
        named; separate column names with comma ",".

    --rotate
        Turn the columns into rows and the rows into columns.

    --matchup FILE
        Grab the first row from FILE and then rotate STDIN. Usually this is
        used when with grep:

         grep stuff file.tsv | tsv --match file.tsv

    --grep COLUMNS PATTERN
        Look for PATTERN in COLUMNS (comma separate list, names or numbers)

    --select CODE
        Evaluate CODE. The first row of the data must be column names. The
        input will be split and assigned to variables named by the column
        names: if there is a column named "best before", then there will be
        a variable $best_before that has the data corresponding to the "best
        before" column for that row. The entire row will be in $_. The first
        row will always print since it's a header. A true value from the
        code will cause the line to print. Do not use "return": the code is
        inside a while loop, not a sub.

    --validate
        Only output rows that have the same number of columns as the header
        line.

    --default VALUE
        Replace empty values with VALUE. This can be combined with
        --validate. This will not pad the number of columns to match the
        header.

    -n --head COUNT
        Only process until there are COUNT lines of data output. This can be
        combined with all the other options except --show. The header does
        not count towards the count.
